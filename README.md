Project about predict how difficult English language in particular movie.

My first try to use Natural Language Processing

I tried to make a model to predict difficulty of English language in movies.

I used three models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression and CatBoost.

Logistic Regression showed the best results in my project.

File 'Movie_project_normalize.ipynb' use the preprocessed file 'df_norm.csv' instead of many files in different directories on my comp that i used initially.
